# weatherChecker

## Description

An application that checks the current and 5-day forecast weather from a city input by a user. Users are also able to search for weather based on their search history, which is generated in buttons in a separate window.

## Location

The site is live at the following URL:

## Developer Comments

User input is taken from the upper-left corner. Current weather is displayed in the upper-right corner, while forecast weather for the next five days is in the bottom-right corner. Search history buttons are rendered in the bottom-left corner, which can be used to re-display weather information from any cities previously searched.
